Oracle Linux scripts

You can find some usefull scripts to manage OL systems or other systems like RHEL and CentOS when migrating to OL.

IMPORTANT

After July/2020 Red Hat changed Subscription License and, due to this change, you can not do a simple conversion even with 100% binary compatibility between RHEL and OL systems.
Due to this License change, with you want to convert a RHEL system to any other Linux flavor, you need to do a full conversion, when available, or do a reinstall.
